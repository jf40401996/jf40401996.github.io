cSnipe is a tool I built a few years ago when I got very into office chairs. When I first started working out of college it was the middle of COVID and everything was remote, I was working out of one of those plastic fold out chairs you see at BBQs and it was wrecking my back, in order to find good deals on better office chairs I made this program to let me know of decent deals in my area, was able to make a little money off of it as well.
