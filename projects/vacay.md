VerifiedTeachers is a platform that I helped create as a co-founder of a VerifiedTeachers LLC.

VerifiedTeacher is implemented using Angular. Within two weeks, we created a website that allows users to sign up, connect with state certified education professionals, and pay for their services.

In this project I gained experience with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including [MongoDB](http://mongodb.com) for database storage, the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework for the user interface, and Javascript for both client and server-side programming.
